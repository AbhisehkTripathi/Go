## üìú History of Go

- **Created By**: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson (at Google)
- **Initial Release**: November 2009
- **Stable Version**: Go 1 released in March 2012 (focus on long-term stability)
- **Motivation**:
  - Improve programming productivity in an era of multicore processors and large codebases.
  - Eliminate the complexity of C++ while keeping its performance.
  - Enable fast compilation and easier concurrency.

Go was designed to solve practical engineering challenges at Google‚Äîespecially related to scalability and performance.
